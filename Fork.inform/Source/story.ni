"Drone Wars" by Jethro

When play begins: say "[italic type]You have once again lost in a drone war against your friend. You are ready to give up and go home, disappointed in yet another failed attempt at luring and attacking him from behind. Just as you decide to give up your wings for good, you friend offers you a hand up...[roman type]". The Forest is a room. "You stand in a clearing in the deep jungle. Obscured by centuries of overgrowth and dim sunlight is a ruined temple of some sort. Whatever details there may have been on the stone blocks have long since been worn away. There is a single, solitary entryway leading downward."
A drone is  here. "A low flying drone pokes out behind some green grass." The description is "[if we have not examined the drone]Upon further examination, you notice that it's struggling to stay in the air. You should examine it further[otherwise]Now that you look at it again, you can see clearly that it has a thick transparent layer of slime on its blades; a nasty looking slime, at that[end if]."
After taking the drone:
say "[if we have not taken the drone] You deftly grab the palm sized drone, clean the blades, and toss it into your pocket."
After dropping the drone: say "You discard the abused drone to the ground like a used facial tissue."
Tossing is an action applying to one thing. Understand "toss [something]" as tossing.
Before tossing the drone: say "You toss the drone upwards and hear its motor whirl as it begins to levitate at shoulder height."
